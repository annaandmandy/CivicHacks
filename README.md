Introduction

Biodiversity is vital for life on Earth, yet it faces severe threats. With over 10 million species, up to 86% remain undescribed (Mora et al., 2011). Human activities like climate change, habitat destruction, and poaching accelerate extinction rates (Ceballos et al., 2015). Currently, 25% of species and 45% of plants are at risk, with up to 75% of undescribed species facing "dark extinctions" (Antonelli et al., 2023; Boehm & Cronk, 2021).

In this project, we mainly aim to create a website,
introduce those natural history collections in a user-friendly way with different sorts of target users.

- Data Description
  - Due to the time limit, we aim to narrow down our targeted country to United States only and acquire about one million rows.
- Data Processing
  - Errors happened during the transformation from txt file to readable csv file, the 'state' column contains location name that doesn't even exist. 
  
- Data Visualization
- Web Design
